# Bioinformatics Approach to Predict Candidiasis-Related MicroRNAs  

## Overview  
This repository contains supplemental materials related to the Master's dissertation by **Tiago Pereira de Miranda**, developed at the **University of Minho's School of Engineering**.  
The dissertation, titled *"Development of a Bioinformatics Approach to Predict Candidiasis-Related MicroRNAs"*, is supervised by:  
- **Dr. Bruna Gon√ßalves**  
- **Dr. Filipa Ferraz**  

<br>

## Project Context  
This research is part of the **Chip4VVC project**, which aims to develop a portable microfluidic system integrated with optical biosensors for the rapid diagnosis of **vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC)**. Funded by **LABBELS**, the project seeks to enhance VVC management through innovative diagnostic tools.
