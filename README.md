# Bioinformatics Approach to Predict Candidiasis-Related MicroRNAs  

## Overview  
This repository contains supplemental materials related to the Master's dissertation by **Tiago Miranda**, developed at the **University of Minho's School of Engineering**.  
The dissertation, titled *"Development of a Bioinformatics Approach to Predict Candidiasis-Related MicroRNAs"*, is supervised by:  
- **Dr. Bruna Gon√ßalves**  
- **Dr. Filipa Ferraz**  

<br>

## Project Context  
This research is part of the **Chip4VVC project**, which aims to develop a portable microfluidic system integrated with optical biosensors for the rapid diagnosis of **vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC)**. Funded by **LABBELS**, the project seeks to enhance VVC management through innovative diagnostic tools.  

<br>

## Project Objective:  
To develop a bioinformatics framework capable of accurately predicting microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with candidiasis. This project integrates data science, molecular biology, and clinical microbiology to enhance the understanding of Candida infections and support innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches based on miRNA biomarkers.
